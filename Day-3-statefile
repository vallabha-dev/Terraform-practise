What is Terraform statefile? { I don't know what is there in remote(cloud), so i take the help of statefile}
First time-Track all resources information from cloud
Second time- After every 'terraform plan/apply' command, statefile will refresh and track the resource.
Work like a interface between working directory and remote(cloud). Bridge between desired state and acual state
Use case:important!!!!
1. When you delete statefile, and again enter terraform apply, since statefile is not there in the working directory, it create another resource
2. When you change the instance type, then statefile tracks the resource, existing instance will stop, type will change and again instance will restart
3. When you  enter the wongly ami id, terraform apply,  then statefile tracks the resource, existing will be deleted first, new one willn't be created.
4. When server is created and deleted, statefile will be null
5. Manually you changed the instance name ex tag = test, but in your working directory tag = dev, then enter terraform plan, you will see actual state is Test, desired state is Dev. Here Instance won't be deleted/stopped/terminnated for renoming
6. Server stopped manually, enterTerraform plan, you won't see change of the state, because Terraform is Infrastructure as the code, not worry about state
